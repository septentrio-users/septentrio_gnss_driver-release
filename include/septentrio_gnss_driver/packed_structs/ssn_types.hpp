/**
 * @file ssn_types.hpp
 * @brief Aims at making the C++ code as portable as possible, by dealing with all
 * compilers except for MS compilers
 *
 * MS compilers are disregarded since ROS Windows is not supported.
 * Here we declare Septentrio types and implement common C/C++ types which are not
 * implemented by every compiler. If your compiler does not support the standard C99
 * types from \p stdint.h and \p stdbool.h, please define them for your platform.
